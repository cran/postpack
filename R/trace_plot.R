#' @title Create a trace plot for a single desired node
#' @param post A [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] object.
#' @param param A regular expression that matches a single element in the model.
#'   E.g., `"b0[1]"`, not `"b0"`. See [match_params()].
#' @param keep_percent A numeric vector of length == 1 and on the range (0,1].
#'   Percent of samples you'd like to keep for trace plotting and passed to [post_thin()].
#' @note If saving as a pdf file, these files can get very large with many samples and render slowly.
#'   The `keep_percent` argument is intended to help with this by thinning the chains at quasi-evenly spaced intervals.
#'   This is **not** a function users will generally use directly. Call [diag_plots()] instead.
