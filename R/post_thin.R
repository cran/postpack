#' @title Perform post-MCMC thinning
#' @description Removes iterations from each chain of a [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list]
#'   object at quasi-evenly spaced intervals. Post-MCMC thinning is useful for
#'   developing long-running post-processing code with a smaller but otherwise identical [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list].
#' @param post A [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] object.
#' @param keep_percent Proportion (between 0 and 1) of samples to keep from each chain.
#'   Setting `keep_percent = 0.2` will remove approximately 80 percent of the samples.
#' @param keep_iters Number of samples to keep from each chain.
#' @details The samples will be removed at as evenly spaced intervals
#'   as possible, however, this is not perfect. It is therefore recommended
#'   to use the full posterior for final post-processing calculations, but this should be fine for
#'   most development of long-running code.
#'
#'   If both `keep_percent` and `keep_iters` are supplied, an error will be returned requesting that only
#'   one be used.
#' @note Iteration numbers are reset after thinning the samples. So if running [post_dim()]
#'   on output passed through `post_thin()`, you cannot trust the burn-in or thinning counts.
#'   Again, this is not an issue for developing post-processing code.
#' @return A [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] object, identical to `post`, but with fewer samples of each node.
