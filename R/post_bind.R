#' @title Combine two objects containing posterior samples
#' @description Intended for use when derived quantities are calculated from monitored posterior samples,
#'   and you wish to combine them into the master [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list],
#'   as though they were calculated and monitored during MCMC sampling.
#'   It is not advised to combine samples from two MCMC runs, because covariance
#'   of MCMC sampling would be lost.
#' @param post1 A [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] or [`matrix`][base::matrix] object.
#' @param post2 A [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] or [`matrix`][base::matrix] object.
#' @param dup_id If any node names are duplicated in `post2`, what should be appended to the
#'   end of these node names in the output? If this occurs a warning will be returned.
#'   Defaults to `"_p2"`
#' @details Some important things to note:
#'   * If the object passed to `post1` is a [`matrix`][base::matrix], `post2` must be a [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list], and vice versa.
#'   * That is, two [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] objects are allowed, but not two [`matrix`][base::matrix] objects.
#'   * For [`matrix`][base::matrix] objects, nodes should be stored as columns and samples should be stored as rows. Column names should be present.
#'   * The objects passed to `post1` and `post2` must have the same number of chains, iterations, burnin, and thinning interval.
#'   * If the node names are empty (e.g., missing column names in a [`matrix`][base::matrix]), the node names will be coerced to `"var1"`, `"var2"`, etc. and a warning will be returned.
#' @return A single [`mcmc.list`][coda::mcmc.list] object containing samples of the nodes from both `post1` and `post2`.
