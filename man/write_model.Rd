\title{Export BUGS/JAGS model from function to file}
\usage{
write_model(fun, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{A function object containing BUGS/JAGS model code}

\item{file}{A character vector of length == 1: the name of the file to write to}
}
\value{
Nothing, but \code{file} is written to disk.
}
\description{
Performs the same basic function as \code{\link[R2OpenBUGS:write.model]{R2OpenBUGS::write.model()}}
}
\details{
Performs the same basic function as \code{\link[R2OpenBUGS:write.model]{R2OpenBUGS::write.model()}},
but with slightly better output (scientific notation, spacing, etc.). The main reason it was created
for use in 'postpack' was to remove the need for using the 'R2OpenBUGS' package when not using OpenBUGS.
