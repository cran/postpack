\title{Example mcmc.list 2}
\format{
A \code{\link[coda:mcmc.list]{mcmc.list}} object.
}
\source{
This object stores samples from the same hypothetical example as for the \code{\link{cjs}} example object,
with one small change to the model. The \code{rho} term that models correlation between slopes and intercepts
was forced to be zero, rather than estimating it. Consult \code{vignette("example-mcmclists")} for more details.
}
\usage{
cjs_no_rho
}
\description{
An example of samples from a joint posterior distribution from a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model.
\strong{The specific context does not matter, this object is provided to show examples of 'postpack' functionality}.
